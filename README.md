### üöÄ Performance Features
- Smart caching for git history and diffs
- Debounced cursor movement handling
- Efficient diff formatting and display

## Usage

1. Open any file in your git repository
2. Move your cursor to any line
3. Look for the üîç indicator at the end of the line
4. Hover over the line to see its git history
5. Click "Show Diff" to view the detailed changes

## Notes
- If syntax highlighting doesn't appear in the diff view, it may be due to your chosen UI theme not providing syntax highlighting for `.diff` files.
- If text in the line that your cursor is hovering over is not visible in diff view, it may be the line doesn't exist in git diff output or there is no change in the line.
